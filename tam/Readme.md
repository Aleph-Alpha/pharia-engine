# Technical Architecture Modelling

TAM is a standard which takes Block Diagrams from FMC (Fundamental Modelling Concepts) and most of the others from UML. This folder contains technical drawings which are relevant for the Pharia Kernel.

Technically this are editable `.svg` files. The stencils to create or edit them can be found here: <https://github.com/ariel-bentu/tam-drawio>.
