# Pharia Kernel

The Pharia Kernel is a serverless lambda engine for skills.

The Pharia Kernel enables you to define, publish, and execute your cognitive business units (called 'skills').
It provides a simple cognitive system interface (CSI) and handles accidental complexity like runtime error handling, CSI authorization, etc. so that you can focus on your AI business logic written in Python, Go, or Rust.
