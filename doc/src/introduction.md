# Pharia Kernel

The Pharia Kernel is a serverless lambda engine for cognitive business units and acts as an 'opinionated message bus'
between your business applications and Aleph Alpha`s cognitive system services such as inference- and retrieval- services.

The Pharia Kernel enables you to define, publish, and execute your cognitive business units (called 'skills').
It provides a simple cognitive system interface (CSI) and handles accidental complexity like runtime error handling, CSI authorization, etc. so that you can focus on your AI business logic written in Python, Go, or Rust.
