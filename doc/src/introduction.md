# Pharia Kernel

Welcome to Pharia Kernel ðŸ‘‹

The Kernel provides a focussed environment for AI engineers to develop and deploy AI methodology, or Skills. These Skills can interact with the world using the **C**ognitive **S**ystem **I**nterface (CSI), which is an interface with functionality biased towards the domain of generative AI. The CSI is also the only way these skills can interact with the world. While this may seem restrictive, it facilitates a frictionless deployment experience and ensures security during execution.
