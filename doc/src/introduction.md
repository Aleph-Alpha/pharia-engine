# Pharia Kernel

Welcome to Pharia Kernel ðŸ‘‹

You might be wondering what the Kernel is. On some level of detail we are still in the process of figuring that out ourselfes. What we know so far is that it allows you to deploy and execute user defined code (we call it skills). These Skills can interact with the world using the **C**ognitive **S**ystem **I**nterface (CSI). Which is an interface with functionality biased towards the domain of generative AI. The CSI is also the only way these skills can interact with the world. This can admittedly be restrictive, but also helps us to make the experience of deploying them frictionless and executing them secure.
