# Executing Skills

In order to call Skills you can use the Pharia Kernel HTTP interface. You can interact with a rendered version of our OpenAPI specification using the route `https://<your-pharia-kernel-host>/api-docs`. If you are reading this documentation, served by the Kernel itself, you may just replace the `/docs/` in the URL with `/api-docs`.

In order to authenticate the requests, we currently use Aleph Alpha Bearer tokens. So please select Bearer as the authentication method.

## How do I get an Aleph Alpha API token

For on-premise installations, contact the Adminstrator of your stack. If you are interacting with the hosted version, you can go to <https://app.aleph-alpha.com> and navigate to your profile page to create a token.
