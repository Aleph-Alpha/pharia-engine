# Executing Skills

In order to call skills developed by you or your colleages you can use the Pharia Kernel http Interface. You can interact with a rendered version of our OpenAPI specification using the route `https://<your-pharia-kernel-host>/api-docs`. If you read this documentation, served by the kernel itself, you may just replace the `/docs/` in the URL with `/api-docs`.

In order to Authenticate the requests we currently use Aleph Alpha Bearer tokens. So please select Bearer as an authentication method. 

## How do I get an Aleph Alpha API token

For on premise installations contact the Adminstrator of your stack. If you are interacting with the hosted version, you can navigate to <https://app.aleph-alpha.com> navigate to your profile page and create a token.
