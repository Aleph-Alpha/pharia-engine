# Skills

The Pharia Skill is a command line interface (CLI) tool that allows you to publish your skills and that provides the
bindings for the programming language you want to write your skill in (Python, Go, or Rust).

The [Haiku skill repository](https://gitlab.aleph-alpha.de/engineering/haiku-skill-python) demonstrates how to use the
Pharia Skill tool on a real live example.
