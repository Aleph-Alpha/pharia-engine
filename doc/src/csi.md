# Cognitive System Interface

The Cognitive System Interface (CSI) exposes inference services such as [completion, summarization, Q&A, etc](https://docs.aleph-alpha.com/api/complete/) as well as index services used for retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

The Pharia Skill tool provides bindings for your language of choice (Python, Go, or Rust) so that you can import the CSI in your skill code easily.
