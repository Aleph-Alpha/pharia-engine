# Delete Skills from Cache

You can remove cached skills from the runtime. With the first invocation, skills are loaded to the runtime. This leads to faster execution on the second invocation. If a skill is updated in the repository, it needs to be removed from the cache so that the new version becomes available in the kernel.
