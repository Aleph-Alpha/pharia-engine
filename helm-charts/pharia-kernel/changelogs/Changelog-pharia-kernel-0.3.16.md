### Description of Changes:

Release v0.13.22 includes several changes, including allowing empty choice stream chunks for GitHub compatibility, handling tool call events with role and content, and improving event handling. The code has been refactored to return a vector of events from streams and to use a normal implementation block for event conversion. Additionally, the API now returns a 401 error when no token is provided, and documentation has been added for contributing and licensing. Unneeded since gates have also been removed from the 0.4 wit world.
