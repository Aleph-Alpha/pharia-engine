### Description of Changes:

This version introduces several key features and improvements, including the addition of chat streaming endpoints to the CSI shell and skills, as well as the connection of unstable chat streaming to skills. The inference client now supports chat streaming, and the CSI drivers and skill invocation context have been updated to work with chat streams. Additionally, the StubCsi and CsiForSkills have been refactored to include chat functionality, and the wit bindings have been updated to include an initial unstable wit streaming chat interface. Other changes include the addition of completion streams to the dev CSI, the refactoring of the CSI API to a dedicated router, and the renaming of certain functions and variables to improve clarity and consistency. The version also includes several bug fixes and minor updates, including the bumping of dependencies and the fixing of clippy lints.
