### Description of Changes:

This version includes several updates and bug fixes. The documentation was updated with a new URL to the Python SDK and a typo was fixed. Error handling was improved, including returning the correct error message when a stream skill is invoked via run and treating TOO_MANY_REQUEST as recoverable. Additionally, syntax errors in namespace configuration are now classified as unrecoverable. New features include logging invalid user input as info and introducing minimal tracing for skill invocation errors. The code was also refactored to improve handling of CSI errors in metadata calls and to extract the SkillDriver from the SkillRuntime.
