## Sub Chart Name - pharia-kernel
## Sub Chart Version - 0.3.14
## Release Date - 2025-08-04

### Description of Changes:

The skill could not be executed to completion, the namespace kernel is misconfigured. If you are the developer who configured the skill, you should probably fix this error. If you are not, there is nothing you can do, until the developer who maintains the list of skills to be served, fixes this. Original Syntax error: HTTP status client error (401 Unauthorized) for url (https://gitlab.aleph-alpha.de/api/v4/projects/1040/repository/files/kernel.toml/raw?ref=main)
