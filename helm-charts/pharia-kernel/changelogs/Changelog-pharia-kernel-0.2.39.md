### Description of Changes:

This version includes several key updates. The kernel has been released as version 0.11.13. The code has been refactored to use ByteSize for better readability of skill cache sizes and to set cache capacity at the top level. New features include reading memory request and limit configuration options from the environment and adding memory request/limit environment variables to the pharia-kernel deployment. Documentation has been updated with examples for message stream responses. The dashboard has been updated, and the quick_cache has been replaced with moka for skill caching. Additionally, the code has been styled to fix lint issues and the skill cache has been pulled into its own module. Finally, the dependencies have been bumped with two updates.
