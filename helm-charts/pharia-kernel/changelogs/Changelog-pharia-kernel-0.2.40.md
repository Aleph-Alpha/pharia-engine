### Description of Changes:

This version includes several updates and improvements. A new kernel release (v0.11.14) was made, and a test was fixed to prevent flakiness. Comments were added to define the weight of a skill and an eviction listener was added to log when items are removed from the cache. The target cache size is now automatically determined, and the skill cache capacity estimation was improved based on memory usage. Additionally, dependencies were updated, and documentation was improved by renaming the `example` namespace in examples.
