### Description of Changes:

This version includes several key changes and improvements. The skill cache has been extracted into a dedicated struct, and control flow consuming skill events have been simplified to prevent duplicate errors in the execution stream. Error messages have been improved, and various APIs have been refactored to use traits instead of async traits, making the code more efficient and easier to maintain. Additionally, several deprecated routes and endpoints have been removed, and the codebase has been cleaned up to take advantage of the new trait-based approach.
