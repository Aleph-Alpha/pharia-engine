### Description of Changes:

This version includes several updates and improvements. The release was fixed to report updated tools if an existing MCP server is configured for a new namespace. The MCP servers are now ordered by name when listed. The codebase has been refactored with several changes, including introducing an alias for BoxedCsi, removing async_trait from SkillComponent, renaming WasmExecutable to SkillComponent, and moving trait bounds from WasmExecutable to its implementation. Additionally, dependencies were updated, including bumping the minor group, updating aquasecurity/trivy-action, and updating wasmtime and hyper-util.
