### Description of Changes:

This version includes several updates and bug fixes. A new kernel release (v0.11.6) was made, and documentation was improved by fixing a typo. Code style was also improved by removing unnecessary let bindings. The WasmRuntime was refactored to store moved data outside of it, and metrics were updated to only measure message execution time. Function metrics were also updated to only measure execution time without fetching. Error handling was pushed down to the WasmRuntime for Message Streams and functions. Python test skills were refactored to use uv, and a triage file was added with a minimum severity of medium. A .trivyignore file was added, and the pipeline was updated to include a Trivy scan. The OpenTelemetry version was also updated, and dependencies were bumped with 10 updates.
