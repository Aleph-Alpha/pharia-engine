//! The Pharia Kernel Engine Room

//! This library hopefully contains and abstracts all of the core wasmtime knowledge needed to run
//! skills within the Pharia Kernel. There will still be bindings and linking that happens outside
//! of this library, but everything related to efficient execution of wasm components, regardless
//! of the world it targets, should live here.
