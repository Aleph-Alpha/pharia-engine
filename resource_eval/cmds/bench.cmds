# adds and accesses multiple skills, here another 4 adding up to 5 all together

# access a specific skill, that is rather difficult, you have to guess the name 
# which has a number appended, and know the parameters
# Here we execute sample1 with Alice to greet and use 100 KByte of memory for 20 ms
